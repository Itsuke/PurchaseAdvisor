# Purchase_Advisor
MCDA purchase advisor for polish e-commerce page Ceneo.pl

## Usage
TBA - For now it's simply running the main.py script while modifying the MCDA() param inputs. 

## Plans for growth
Close Future:
1) Adding the graphical result showcase (anything more user friendly than prints in python console)
2) Having the interface in one window instead of four
3) Form of an app instead of python scripts. 
4) Try to cover GUI with unit tests

Far Future:
1) Adding more portals
2) Translating collected data from Ceneo.pl ?
3) Preparing more general backend so the that others e-commerce platforms could be used if data were given.
